# Module Inquiry 1

## Questions

1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?

    Because the intended users of our product are children, I asked if the user-onboarding should be geared toward children or their parents. The stakeholders definitely want the parents to be involved, but the product is designed for their children, and the stakeholders made it clear the children should be our focus


2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.
    
    * Students (users) should be able to create and log into their account.

    * Students should be able to read stories in pdf form. (Stakeholder will offer the stories.)



3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?

    My favorite user story is "Students should be able to create and log into their account." I like this user story because it is an essential part of nearly all applications. I have built more than a few sign-up and login forms, so this is something I am very familiar and comfortable with.

    In order to accomplish this, we will need to craft forms for users to enter all the relevant  information. These forms will mainly include text inputs, and password inputs (which will hide the passwords as they are being entered). The sign-up form will also need an email input, and most likely a number input to keep track of the user's age. Our team will also need to build a backend API for us to store and maintain all the user data


    - What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?

        I was able to clearly state my capabilities to my team, and let them know that I felt comfortable building both the frontend and backend portions of the app.

        My team has some members that are substantially more comfortable leading the conversations. This made it difficult for me to participate in the discussions and planning. I am confident in my abilities as a programmer, but I have always found it difficult to speak up in a group. I am too comfortable being quiet and working around the preferences of others. I definitely need more practice at speaking my mind and sharing my opinions.


4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?

    Today every member of my team was introduced to our project for the very first time. Because of this, we could only discuss our ideas and plans as broad concepts. Once we have some experience working with the code, I believe we will have a much better idea of how to structure and attack future plans. Also, for most of my team, this will be the first time we have worked with one another. After we have more experience working as a team, we will have a better understanding of everyone's strengths and weaknesses, and will be able to assign tasks more effectively.

    In the future, I will definitely spend more time looking at the tasks on my own and write down my thoughts before meeting with my team. This way I will be more prepared to speak my mind in a group setting, instead of having to come up with new ideas on the spot. I believe this will greatly improve my ability to collaborate with my teammates.

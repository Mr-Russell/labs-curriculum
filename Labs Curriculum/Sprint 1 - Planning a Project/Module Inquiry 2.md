# Module Inquiry 2

## Questions

1. What technical choices did you make today? 

    Our team made an overall plan on how to structure our app. As a team, we decided what data we would need to store in our database, and the different API endpoints we would need. 


2. Pick two technical choices you're happy with. What was your thought process as you made those choices? What did you consider and what did you decide against?

    I was really happy we went over the general Database Schema, and the API endpoints. These will both be very valuable to have on hand while structuring our app


    - Take a moment to think about the advantages in choosing the route that you did.

        Planning out our database schema and endpoints gives us the ability to build our app around all the data we need to account for. 


    - Now take a moment to consider the disadvantages.

        We did not spend much time discussing how our app will look and function on the frontend. We were provided a wireframe (figma) from our stakeholders, we did not discuss the functionality in depth as a team. Though, I am sure this is something that will evolve as we build the app

3. In one or two sentences, summarize why you ultimately made the choice you did.

        Since our team consists of Data Scientists and Web Developers, it is important that everyone agrees how the flow of our app should work before we start building a product. If we all started working independently, we would inevitably run into issues that can easily be avoided with just a quick discussion. 


4. Extracting useful conclusions from your process: 
    - According to your understanding, what makes a good technical choice?

        A good technical choice is one that is simple to implement, works efficiently, and is satisfactory to every member of the team.

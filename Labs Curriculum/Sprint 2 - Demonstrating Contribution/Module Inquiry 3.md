## Questions

1. What feature did you work on with a teammate up to this point in the sprint?

      The one component I have worked on the most so far is the Header / Top Banner


2. When were you the driver? When were you the navigator? Which role did you prefer and why?

      Me and one of my teammates, Sone, took turns being the driver and navigator. I personally prefer to be the navigator. I am not very good at taking direction when coding. Once I get an idea in my head, I find it difficult to stop writing code until I have written everything possible to execute that idea. If someone throws out an idea while I'm in the middle of typing, I get agitated when they don't wait until I have finished fleshing out my code first. Even if what I am being told is extremely helpful, my natural response still seems to be agitation. This is definitely something I need to work on personally


3. What was difficult about being a navigator?

      Being a navigator is very difficult when the driver is more knowledgeable then me. In such cases, I find it difficult to direct the driver because they are clearly able to accomplish the task without my input. I am hesitant to comment because I feel like any comment I make would only interrupt their flow, and slow the driver down. When this happens, I feel like I pretty much just stay silent and watch the driver type up his code. 


4. How will you adjust your pair programming behavior in the future?

      As a driver I definitely need to remind myself that any comments that are given to me are not personal attacks, and only meant to help gide me or improve my code. 
      
      And as a navigator, whenever I am programming with someone who I feel is more knowledgeable than me, I need to have more confidence and speak up with suggestions. Even if the driver does have a deeper understanding of the code and concepts, there are countless ways to achieve the same goal. People approach problems differently, and different perspectives can be incredibly insightful when trying to work through a problem.

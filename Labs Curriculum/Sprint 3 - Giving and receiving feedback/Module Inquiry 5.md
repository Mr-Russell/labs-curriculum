## Questions

1. Pick one team member. What is a piece of feedback you have yet to give them?

    Sone is really good at finding useful packages and resources that I never would have found without him.


2. What's an example of some recent feedback you received that was easy to hear? What about recent feedback that was difficult to hear? What do you think made them easy or difficult to process?

    Something that was easy to hear is when Sone and I were pair programming, and he complimented my solution to a styling problem we had. It was more of an off-the-cuff statement he made where he said "That's really clever! I like that a lot." It's always nice to get positive feedback, but that compliment sounded very genuine, and thats what I valued most. 

    Something that was difficult for me to hear is when I was offered a solution that I did not quite agree with. We both came up with different workable solutions, but I just preferred my idea much more. I don't know why this bothered me as much as it did. I guess doing something else other than what I suggested makes me feel like my solution must be inferior, even though it is no better or worse, just different


3. What's the most memorable feedback you've ever received? What was it about the feedback that made such an impact?

    I learned how to play the guitar when I was a teenager. I always thought I was not very good. A friend of mine was much better than I was. He asked me to play a song with him "just for fun." I was embarrassed because I didn't think I could keep up with him, or that I would mess up too much and that would distract my friend from playing well too. So I shared my feelings with him he told me "you'll get better." It was weird how his confidence was so inspiring. It was almost like I thought I wold never improve no matter how much I tried. But my friend had more confidence in me that I didn't even have in myself. I try to remind myself that I am capable of achieving my goals, even if I need to work harder than some other people do to


4. What do you think the difference is between constructive and non-constructive feedback?

    Some feedback, while true, can be a bit harsh when it is said out loud. It's not just about what you say, it's also really important how you say it. There is no reason to be rude or even downright mean. Constructive feedback aims at helping someone improve themselves. Non-constructive feedback is a lot like bullying, where the person giving the feedback is more insulting than helpful

## Questions

1. What's an example of feedback you were scared to give?

        I was very hesitant to give any negative feedback to all of my team members. Though we have been dividing up all the responsibilities, so most of us have not been working together directly.


2. What were some common pieces of positive feedback you found yourself giving to team members?

        I said one of my team members was very good at finding useful resources online

    - Why do you think they were common?
        
        As a developer, since programming is constantly changing and improving, you need to be able to learn new concepts on your own, so finding useful resources is just part of being a good developer.


3. What were some common pieces of growth feedback you found yourself giving to team members?

        I said one of my group members should restrain themselves from setting their goals too high.

    - Why do you think they were common?

        A good developer always wants to build the best possible product they can. But for this project we need to deliver what a stakeholder is asking of us. We need to be able to give the stakeholders what they want before we provide anything extra. 


4. Are there any examples of feedback you would word differently if given another chance?

        I tried really hard to word my responses in the kindest possible way. I am not very good at criticising others, so I always try to word it in a positive manner.

    - Why would you change your wording?

        I wouldn't change the wording, but I definitely need to work on what criticism I give. I am afraid of being too harsh, so I offer different, more gentle criticism than what I actually want to say. 

5. Do you feel like your feedback could have been clearer? How can you improve in the future?

        My feedback definitely could have been clearer. I could have provided more specific examples of certain times when I felt my team members needed improvement. I will be sure to be much more descriptive in the future.
